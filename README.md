# Telecom Domain - Customer Churn Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. The dataset undergoes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training to identify key patterns and predict customer churn.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Name:** `Telcom Data.csv`  
- **Description:** The dataset contains customer details, service usage, contract details, and churn status, helping to analyze why customers leave the telecom service.  

## 🚀 Key Steps  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Handling Missing Values  
   - Detecting and Removing Duplicates  
   - Visualizing Key Features  
2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Encoding Categorical Variables  
   - Handling Imbalanced Data  
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Splitting data into Train & Test sets  
   - Training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest  
   - Evaluating Performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Train-Test Split, Feature Engineering, Model Training)

## 📀 Results & Insights  
Key Insights from Customer Churn Analysis:

- Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn compared to those with long-term contracts.

- High service charges and additional fees contribute to customer dissatisfaction and churn.

- Customers who do not use tech support or customer service frequently tend to leave.

- Senior citizens and customers with lower tenure are more prone to churning.

- Payment method also plays a role; customers using electronic checks show a higher churn rate.
